- **02-services.md** - Complete service offerings, technology stack, and what sets us apart
- **03-pricing-packages.md** - Investment ranges, what's included/excluded, payment terms
- **04-process-methodology.md** - 6-phase development process and project management approach
- **05-portfolio-case-studies.md** - Examples of past work, client results, and testimonials

### Customer Support
- **06-faq-common-questions.md** - Frequently asked questions organized by category

### AI Configuration  
- **07-bot-personality-settings.md** - ZeroBot's personality, communication style, and conversation flow
- **~~08-lead-qualification-rules.md~~** - Removed: Lead scoring system (now using simple lead collection)

## ü§ñ How ZeroBot Uses This Knowledge

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System
1. **User asks a question** ‚Üí ZeroBot analyzes the query
2. **Vector search** ‚Üí Finds relevant knowledge chunks using semantic similarity
3. **Context injection** ‚Üí Relevant information is added to the GPT-5 prompt
4. **Response generation** ‚Üí GPT-5 creates a personalized, accurate response
5. **Lead collection** ‚Üí Contact information is collected naturally during conversation

### Knowledge Categories for RAG
- **Company Information** - About us, values, location, team
- **Services & Solutions** - What we build, how we build it, technology stack
- **Pricing & Investment** - Cost ranges, what's included, payment terms
- **Process & Timeline** - How we work, project phases, deliverables
- **Portfolio & Results** - Case studies, client outcomes, testimonials
- **Support & FAQ** - Common questions, technical answers, policies

### Conversation Management
- **Personality Guide** - How ZeroBot should communicate and behave
- **Lead Collection** - How to gather contact information naturally
- **Response Templates** - Proven conversation patterns and responses
- **Escalation Triggers** - When to hand off to human team members

## üìù Editing Guidelines

### For Zero Point Labs Team:
1. **Keep information current** - Update pricing, services, and processes regularly
2. **Use consistent terminology** - Follow the language guide in bot personality settings
3. **Include specific details** - The more specific the information, the better ZeroBot can help customers
4. **Test changes** - Use the AI testing environment to verify updates work correctly

### File Update Priority:
- **High**: Services, pricing, company info (affects most conversations)
- **Medium**: Process, portfolio, FAQ (affects specific inquiries)  
- **Low**: Bot personality (affects tone but not content accuracy)

### Latest Updates:
- **Removed lead scoring system** - Now focuses on natural lead collection
- **Updated pricing** - Web apps require consultation, adjusted website ranges
- **Added new services** - Automotive, service businesses, 3D animation sites
- **Simplified bot greetings** - Shorter, more direct initial contact

### When to Update:
- **Immediately**: Price changes, new services, contact info changes
- **Monthly**: Portfolio updates, new case studies, FAQ additions
- **Quarterly**: Process refinements, personality adjustments, qualification rules

## üîÑ RAG System Integration

### How Knowledge Gets Into the AI:
1. **Content chunking** - Each file is broken into semantic chunks
2. **Embedding generation** - OpenAI creates vector embeddings for each chunk
3. **Vector storage** - Embeddings stored in Supabase with pgvector
4. **Similarity search** - Real-time retrieval of relevant information
5. **Context injection** - Selected chunks added to GPT-5 conversation context

### Optimization Tips:
- **Write clear, standalone paragraphs** - Each section should make sense on its own
- **Use descriptive headings** - Helps with context retrieval
- **Include relevant keywords** - Natural language that customers might use
- **Provide specific examples** - Concrete details improve response quality

## üéØ Lead Qualification Integration

### How Lead Collection Works:
1. **Natural conversation flow** - Collect information during helpful discussions
2. **Information extraction** - Contact details, project requirements, timeline
3. **CRM integration** - Lead data stored in Supabase for sales team follow-up
4. **Consultation booking** - Priority on scheduling free consultations
5. **No pressure approach** - Focus on helping first, selling second

### Key Collection Triggers:
- Project interest shown ‚Üí Offer free consultation
- Pricing questions ‚Üí Request consultation for accurate quote
- Specific requirements ‚Üí Gather contact info for detailed discussion
- Timeline urgency ‚Üí Schedule consultation quickly
- Technical questions ‚Üí Connect with development team

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### What to Track:
- **Answer accuracy** - How often ZeroBot provides correct information
- **Lead quality** - Conversion rates from collected leads
- **Common questions** - Gaps in knowledge base coverage
- **Conversation completion** - How many visitors complete qualification flow
- **Customer satisfaction** - Post-conversation feedback scores

### Monthly Review Checklist:
- [ ] Review conversation logs for knowledge gaps
- [ ] Update case studies and portfolio
- [ ] Refresh pricing and service information
- [ ] Analyze lead scoring accuracy
- [ ] Test major conversation flows
- [ ] Update FAQ based on new questions

- Supabase pgvector will store and search embeddings
- GPT-5 will use retrieved context to generate responses

### For Content Managers:
- Edit these files directly to update bot knowledge
- Changes will be reflected after re-embedding process
- Use the AI testing environment to verify changes
- Monitor conversation quality and adjust as needed

### For Sales Team:
- Lead collection approach determines contact gathering
- Bot personality affects first impression and engagement
- Portfolio and case studies influence credibility
- Process documentation sets proper expectations
